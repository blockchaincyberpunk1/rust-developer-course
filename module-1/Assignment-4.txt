Error Handling and Result Types

Objective: To introduce error handling and the Result type in Rust.

Task:

In this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience with error handling in Rust by using the Result type to manage and handle errors gracefully.

Instructions:

Error-Generating Functions:

Instruct students to create a Rust program that deliberately generates errors within specific functions.
Errors can include scenarios such as division by zero, attempting to open a non-existent file, or any other situation that results in a failure.
Encourage students to design these functions so that they return a Result type that represents either success (Ok) or failure (Err).
Result Type and Match Expression:

Have students use the Result type to handle errors gracefully within their program.
For functions that can fail, they should return a Result type with informative error messages included in the Err variant.
In the main program or other functions, instruct students to use the match expression to pattern match and process both the Ok and Err variants appropriately.
Emphasize the importance of providing meaningful error messages to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.
Benefits of Rust's Error Handling:

Initiate a discussion or require students to write a reflection on the benefits of Rust's approach to error handling.
Encourage them to highlight how Rust's strict error handling mechanisms contribute to more robust and reliable code.
Discuss how Result types help prevent unexpected program crashes and make error handling explicit and predictable.
Evaluation Criteria:

Correct implementation of functions generating intentional errors.
Effective use of the Result type to manage errors.
Proper use of the match expression to handle Result variants.
Clarity and informativeness of error messages.
Thoughtful reflection on the advantages of Rust's error handling approach.
