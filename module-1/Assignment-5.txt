Mini-Project - Simple Console Application

Objective: To apply programming concepts learned in Rust to create a small console application.

Task:

In this assignment, students will showcase their Rust programming skills by developing a simple console application. The application should take user input and perform basic operations, demonstrating their proficiency in variables, data types, control structures, functions, and error handling.

Instructions:

Choose a Simple Console Application:

Instruct students to select a specific type of console application to build. Examples include:
A basic calculator (able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
A to-do list manager (able to add, remove, and display tasks).
A word counter (able to count words, characters, or lines in input text).
Encourage creativity and allow students to choose or propose their own console application ideas.
Implementation:

Have students implement the chosen console application using Rust.
They should utilize Rust's features, such as variables, data types, control structures (if, match), and functions, to create a functional program.
Emphasize code organization, readability, and good programming practices.
Error Handling:

Require students to incorporate error handling within their program to handle unexpected input or errors gracefully.
For instance, in a calculator application, they should handle division by zero or invalid mathematical operations.
Ensure that error messages are informative and user-friendly.
Documentation:

Encourage students to include documentation comments (/// or //!) throughout their code.
Documentation comments should explain the purpose of functions, how to use the program, and any specific input requirements.
Presentation and Demonstration:

Depending on the class format, have students present and demonstrate their console applications to the class.
During the presentation, they should showcase the application's functionality and how they handled error cases.
Evaluation Criteria:

Successful implementation of the chosen console application.
Effective use of Rust programming concepts, including variables, data types, control structures, and functions.
Proper error handling to handle unexpected input or errors gracefully.
Quality of documentation comments within the code.
Clarity and effectiveness of the presentation and demonstration (if applicable).
