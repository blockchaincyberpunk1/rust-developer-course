Functions and Code Reusability

Objective: To emphasize the importance of functions and code reusability in Rust.

Task:

In this assignment, students will explore the role of functions in Rust programming and how they contribute to code reusability and maintainability.

Instructions:

Define Custom Functions:

Instruct students to create a Rust program that defines custom functions to perform various common tasks.
Suggest functions such as calculating the factorial of a number, checking for prime numbers, or sorting an array.
Encourage students to add function parameters and return values to make the functions versatile and adaptable to different scenarios.
Function Calls:

Assign specific problems or tasks to students that can be solved by calling the custom functions they have defined.
For example, they can calculate and print the factorial of a user-provided number or find and display prime numbers within a given range.
Ensure that students demonstrate the use of function parameters and return values effectively in these tasks.
Code Organization:

Discuss the advantages of using functions for code organization and reusability.
Have students reflect on how functions help in breaking down complex problems into manageable parts.
Encourage them to consider how functions enhance the readability and maintainability of their code.
Documentation:

Stress the importance of documenting their functions with meaningful comments.
Instruct students to provide descriptions for each function, explain the purpose of parameters, and clarify return values where necessary.
Evaluation Criteria:

Correct implementation of custom functions to solve assigned tasks.
Effective use of function parameters and return values.
Clarity and organization of code with informative comments.
Reflection on the benefits of functions for code reusability and maintainability.
