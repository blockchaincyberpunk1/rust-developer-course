Control Structures in Rust

Objective: To practice using control structures in Rust.

Task:

In this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience with control structures in Rust, which are essential for creating decision-making and looping logic in their programs.

Instructions:

Conditional Statements:

Instruct students to create Rust programs that implement conditional statements using if, else if, and else.
Encourage them to design programs that:
Prompt the user for input and make decisions based on that input.
Calculate and display different results based on conditions.
Handle various scenarios and user choices using conditional logic.
Require students to include meaningful comments to explain the purpose of each conditional block.
Loops:

Ask students to write Rust programs that make use of loops. They can choose between for or while loops based on the requirements of the task.
Tasks for the loops may include:
Iterating through arrays, vectors, or other data structures.
Summing or processing elements within a collection.
Repeating specific actions until a certain condition is met.
Encourage students to ensure their loops are well-structured and efficient.
Match Expressions:

Introduce students to the concept of match expressions in Rust.
Assign tasks that require pattern matching and handling multiple cases using match.
Examples may include parsing user input, categorizing data, or responding to different input scenarios.
Instruct them to include detailed comments to explain the patterns and outcomes in their match expressions.
Code Comments:

Emphasize the importance of code comments in making their programs understandable.
Encourage students to provide comments throughout their code to explain the logic and purpose of control structures.
Evaluation Criteria:

Correct implementation of conditional statements, loops, and match expressions.
Effective use of control structures to solve the assigned tasks.
Clarity and organization of code with informative comments.
Verification of program functionality through successful testing.
