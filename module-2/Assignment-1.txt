Introduction to Rust Syntax

Objective: To practice writing basic Rust code and understanding its syntax.

Task:

In this assignment, students will get hands-on experience with Rust syntax by creating a simple Rust program. The program should accomplish several basic tasks to ensure they are familiar with the language's core concepts.

Instructions:

Hello, Rust!:

Ask students to create a Rust program that prints "Hello, Rust!" to the console. This is a simple introduction to Rust programming.
Variable Declarations:

Instruct students to declare and initialize variables of different data types, such as:
Integer variables.
Floating-point variables.
String variables.
Boolean variables.
Students should assign meaningful values to these variables.
Formatted Output:

Utilize Rust's println! macro for formatted output. Students should print the values of the variables to the console using println! with appropriate formatting.
Comments and Code Organization:

Emphasize the importance of code readability and organization.
Encourage students to include both single-line and multi-line comments to explain their code.
Require proper code indentation and formatting to enhance code readability.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful implementation of a Rust program that prints "Hello, Rust!".
Correct declaration and initialization of variables of different data types.
Proper use of Rust's println! macro for formatted output.
Inclusion of comments to explain the code.
Code organization, indentation, and overall code readability.
