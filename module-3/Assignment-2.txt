Data Sharing and Ownership in Threads

Objective: To explore data sharing and ownership between threads in Rust.

Task:

In this assignment, students will deepen their understanding of data sharing and ownership between threads in Rust. They will create a Rust program with multiple threads and share a data structure among them to demonstrate Rust's ownership rules and ensure data safety during concurrent access.

Instructions:

Thread Creation and Data Sharing:

Instruct students to write a Rust program that creates multiple threads.
Define a data structure (e.g., a vector, hash map, or any other suitable container) that will be shared among these threads.
Data Initialization:

Populate the shared data structure with initial values before spawning threads.
Concurrent Data Access:

Each thread should have a specific task that involves accessing and modifying the shared data structure.
Demonstrate scenarios where threads read from and write to the shared data structure simultaneously.
Ownership Rules:

Emphasize Rust's ownership and borrowing system as it applies to the shared data.
Discuss how Rust ensures data safety by enforcing rules like mutable borrowing and ownership transfer.
Data Race Mitigation:

Encourage students to intentionally introduce potential data races in their program.
Discuss strategies and Rust-specific techniques (e.g., using Mutex or RwLock) to mitigate data races and ensure thread safety.
Demonstration:

Students should run the program and observe how Rust's ownership rules prevent data races and guarantee data safety during concurrent access.
Discussion:

Engage students in a discussion about the significance of Rust's ownership system in concurrent programming.
Explore real-world applications where shared data and thread safety are critical.
Code Comments:

Encourage students to provide comments in their code to explain the purpose of each thread and the data they access.
Discuss best practices for writing concurrent code that is both efficient and safe.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Creation of multiple threads in the Rust program.
Successful sharing of a data structure among threads.
Demonstrated understanding of Rust's ownership rules and their application to concurrent programming.
Identification and mitigation of potential data races.
Clarity of code comments and explanations.
