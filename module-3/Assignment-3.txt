Send and Sync Traits

Objective: To delve deeper into Rust's Send and Sync traits for safe concurrency.

Task:

In this assignment, students will explore Rust's Send and Sync traits, which play a crucial role in ensuring safe concurrency. They will define a custom struct or type that implements these traits, create multiple threads, and share instances of this type among the threads to demonstrate how Send and Sync guarantee thread safety.

Instructions:

Custom Struct or Type:

Instruct students to define a custom struct or type that encapsulates data they want to share among threads.
This struct or type should implement the Send and Sync traits.
Thread Creation:

Students should write a Rust program that spawns multiple threads.
Sharing Instances:

Share instances of the custom struct or type created earlier among these threads.
Guaranteeing Thread Safety:

Discuss with students how the Send and Sync traits guarantee thread safety in Rust.
Explain that Send indicates that the type can be safely transferred to other threads, while Sync indicates that it can be safely shared between threads without causing data races.
Demonstration:

Have students demonstrate their program, showing how Send and Sync traits ensure thread safety during concurrent access.
Scenarios and Use Cases:

Discuss various scenarios and use cases where these traits are essential in concurrent programming.
Examples may include parallel processing of data, multi-threaded network communication, and more.
Code Comments and Documentation:

Encourage students to provide meaningful comments in their code to explain the role of Send and Sync in their program.
Discuss the importance of documentation and code readability in concurrent Rust code.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful implementation of a custom struct or type that implements the Send and Sync traits.
Correct creation of multiple threads and sharing of instances.
Demonstrated understanding of how Send and Sync traits guarantee thread safety.
Application of Send and Sync traits in scenarios relevant to concurrent programming.
Clarity of code comments and explanations.
