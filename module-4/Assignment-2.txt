Working with Generics

Objective: To teach students about Rust's generic programming capabilities.

Task:

In this assignment, students will explore Rust's generic programming features, which allow for the creation of flexible and reusable code that can work with multiple data types.

Instructions:

Generic Function or Data Structure:

Instruct students to create either a generic function or a generic data structure in Rust.
The generic function or data structure should be capable of working with various data types without specifying them explicitly in the code.
Implement a Generic Algorithm:

Ask students to implement a generic algorithm (e.g., sorting, searching) that operates on generic types.
The algorithm should be capable of handling different data types provided as input.
Demonstrating Flexibility:

Students should create instances of their generic function or data structure and demonstrate its flexibility by using it with different data types.
Showcase how the same code can be reused for various data types.
Advantages of Generics:

Require students to write a brief explanation of the advantages of using generics in Rust.
Encourage them to discuss how generics contribute to code reusability, flexibility, and type safety.
Documentation:

Ensure that students provide clear documentation explaining the purpose and usage of their generic function or data structure.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful creation and implementation of a generic function or data structure.
Correct implementation of a generic algorithm that operates on generic types.
Effective demonstration of the code's flexibility by using it with multiple data types.
Insightful explanation of the advantages of using generics in Rust.
Clear and concise documentation that aids in understanding the code.
