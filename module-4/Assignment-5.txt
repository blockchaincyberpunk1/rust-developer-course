Mini-Project - Generic Data Structure

Objective: To apply traits, generics, and advanced pattern matching in a real-world project.

Task:

In this assignment, students will work on a mini-project to design and implement a generic data structure in Rust. They will apply their knowledge of traits, generics, and advanced pattern matching to create a flexible and powerful data structure that can work with various data types.

Instructions:

Choose a Generic Data Structure:

Assign students the task of designing and implementing a generic data structure. They can choose from options like a linked list, binary tree, hash map, or any other appropriate data structure.
The data structure should be generic, meaning it can store and manipulate data of various types.
Trait Implementation:

Students should define and implement traits for their data structure. Traits should include methods for inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.
Encourage students to design traits that promote code reusability and maintainability.
Generic Data Structure:

Students should create a data structure that adheres to the traits they defined. The data structure should be able to work with different data types, making use of Rust's generics.
Testing:

Instruct students to write comprehensive unit tests to validate the correctness of their generic data structure. Test cases should cover various scenarios and data types.
Emphasize the importance of thorough testing to ensure the data structure's reliability.
Advanced Pattern Matching:

Challenge students to implement advanced pattern matching techniques within their data structure's methods. This can include nested patterns, guards, and pattern combinations.
Ask them to showcase how pattern matching simplifies complex operations and improves code readability.
Documentation and Presentation:

Students should provide clear documentation for their generic data structure, including explanations of traits, data structure design, and advanced pattern matching.
Encourage students to present their project to the class, discussing the benefits of generic data structures in real-world programming.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful implementation of a generic data structure.
Correct and comprehensive implementation of traits.
Thorough and effective unit testing of the data structure.
Demonstration of advanced pattern matching techniques in methods.
Quality of documentation and presentation.
