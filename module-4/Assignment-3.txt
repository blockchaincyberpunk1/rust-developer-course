Advanced Pattern Matching

Objective: To explore advanced pattern matching techniques in Rust.

Task:

In this assignment, students will dive into advanced pattern matching techniques in Rust, which enable developers to write more expressive and concise code.

Instructions:

Complex Pattern Matching:

Instruct students to write Rust code that utilizes match expressions with complex patterns.
Examples of complex patterns can include nested patterns, ranges, and guards.
Encourage students to explore various scenarios where complex patterns are beneficial.
Parsing Structured Data:

Ask students to implement pattern matching to parse structured data formats like JSON or XML.
They should create a Rust program that can extract specific information from these formats using pattern matching.
Provide sample data for parsing, or students can use external crates for working with structured data formats.
Code Expressiveness:

Students should reflect on their experience using advanced pattern matching and discuss how it has improved the readability and expressiveness of their code.
Encourage them to provide examples of before-and-after code to illustrate the impact of pattern matching.
Documentation:

Ensure that students include clear documentation explaining the purpose of their code and how advanced pattern matching is employed.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Effective use of advanced pattern matching techniques, including complex patterns like nested patterns, ranges, and guards.
Successful implementation of pattern matching to parse structured data formats.
Insightful reflection on the improved code expressiveness and readability achieved through advanced pattern matching.
Clear and concise documentation that aids in understanding the code.
