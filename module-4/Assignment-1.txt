Exploring Traits

Objective: To understand Rust's trait system and its role in code abstraction.

Task:

In this assignment, students will explore Rust's trait system, which allows for code reuse and abstraction through trait implementation and polymorphism.

Instructions:

Custom Trait Definition:

Instruct students to define a custom trait in Rust. The trait should include a set of methods (functions) that can be implemented by Rust data types (structs or enums).
Implementing Multiple Types:

Students should create multiple Rust data types, such as structs or enums.
Each data type should implement the custom trait defined in step 1. Students can choose different data types to implement the trait.
Demonstrate Polymorphism:

Write a Rust program that demonstrates polymorphism by using the custom trait.
The program should create instances of the different data types that implement the trait and call the trait's methods on these instances.
Showcase how the same trait methods can be used with different data types, highlighting polymorphism in Rust.
Code Reuse and Abstraction:

Encourage students to discuss how traits enable code reuse and abstraction.
Ask them to explain how implementing a trait for multiple data types can lead to more modular and reusable code.
Documentation:

Require students to provide clear documentation explaining the purpose of the custom trait, the data types implementing it, and how to use the trait in their program.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful definition and implementation of a custom trait in Rust.
Correct implementation of multiple data types (structs or enums) that implement the trait.
Effective demonstration of polymorphism in the Rust program.
Clear and concise documentation explaining the trait's purpose and usage.
Insightful discussion of the advantages of using traits for code reuse and abstraction.
