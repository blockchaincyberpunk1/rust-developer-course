Open-Source Contribution (Beginner)

Objective: To introduce students to open-source contribution in the Rust ecosystem.

Task:

In this assignment, students will have the opportunity to make their first contribution to an open-source Rust project. They will select a beginner-friendly project, resolve an issue labeled as "beginner-friendly" or "good first issue," and submit a pull request (PR) while documenting their experience.

Instructions:

Choose a Rust Open-Source Project:

Instruct students to explore open-source Rust projects on platforms like GitHub (github.com/rust-lang) or other repositories known for hosting Rust projects.
Encourage students to select a project that interests them and is labeled as "beginner-friendly" or "good first issue." Emphasize the importance of choosing a project aligned with their interests.
Fork and Clone the Repository:

Once students have chosen a project, guide them to:
Fork the repository to create their copy.
Clone the forked repository to their local development environment.
Resolve a Beginner-Friendly Issue:

Instruct students to:
Browse the project's issues and select a beginner-friendly issue that they would like to work on.
Read the issue description and any associated discussions to understand the problem or task.
Ask questions or seek clarification from the project's maintainers if needed.
Implement the Solution:

Encourage students to:
Write code to address the issue, following the project's coding style and guidelines.
Include appropriate tests for the changes they are making.
Ensure their code is well-documented and includes comments where necessary.
Commit their changes with clear and descriptive commit messages.
Submit a Pull Request (PR):

Guide students through the process of creating a PR:
Push their changes to their forked repository.
Create a PR from their forked repository to the original project's repository.
Write a descriptive PR title and description, referencing the issue they are addressing.
Follow the project's PR template and guidelines.
Document the Contribution Process:

Ask students to maintain a journal or document of their contribution process. They should record:
Details of the issue they worked on.
Code changes made and tests added.
Interactions with the project's maintainers and community.
Any challenges faced and how they overcame them.
Lessons learned during the contribution process.
Reflect on the Experience:

At the end of the assignment, instruct students to write a reflective report:
Summarize their overall experience contributing to an open-source Rust project.
Discuss the impact of their contribution on the project.
Share insights gained into Rust development and collaboration in open-source communities.
Reflect on the importance of open-source contributions in the Rust ecosystem.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Selection of a suitable open-source Rust project.
Successful resolution of a beginner-friendly issue.
Quality and completeness of code changes and tests.
Proper documentation and adherence to the project's guidelines.
The completeness and organization of their documented contribution process.
The depth and thoughtfulness of their reflective report.
