Rust Ecosystem Exploration

Objective: To encourage students to explore the broader Rust ecosystem.

Task:

In this assignment, students will delve into a specific area of the Rust ecosystem that piques their interest. They will research and prepare a presentation or blog post about their chosen topic, highlighting its relevance and potential applications within the Rust ecosystem.

Instructions:

Choose a Rust-Related Topic:

Instruct students to select a Rust-related topic or ecosystem component that intrigues them. Some examples include:
WebAssembly (Wasm) with Rust.
Embedded systems development with Rust.
Game development using the Rust programming language.
Networking and server-side programming in Rust.
Data science and Rust's role in the field.
Rust's applications in blockchain and cryptocurrency.
Research and Prepare:

Encourage students to conduct in-depth research on their chosen topic. They should gather information from credible sources, Rust documentation, and relevant case studies.
Advise them to organize their findings and insights into a coherent presentation or blog post.
Create a Presentation or Blog Post:

Students can choose between creating a presentation (using tools like Google Slides or PowerPoint) or writing a blog post (using platforms like Medium or a personal blog).
The presentation or blog post should cover the following aspects:
Introduction to the selected topic.
Why the chosen topic is relevant in the Rust ecosystem.
Real-world applications and use cases.
Any notable projects, libraries, or tools related to the topic.
Challenges and advantages of using Rust in this context.
Examples or case studies, if available.
Future prospects and trends in the Rust ecosystem related to the topic.
Present to the Class:

Each student should present their findings to the class in a concise and engaging manner. They can use slides, visuals, and code snippets to illustrate key points.
Presentations should be around 10-15 minutes long, allowing time for questions and discussion afterward.
Class Discussion:

After each presentation, facilitate a class discussion where students can ask questions, share their thoughts, and discuss the presented topic.
Encourage students to consider how the topic might impact their own projects or areas of interest within Rust development.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Selection of an interesting and relevant Rust-related topic.
Depth of research and quality of information gathered.
Clarity, organization, and creativity in the presentation or blog post.
Ability to engage the class during the presentation.
Active participation in the class discussion.
