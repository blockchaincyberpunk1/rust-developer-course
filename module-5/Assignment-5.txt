Code Review and Safety Analysis

Objective: To reinforce safe coding practices and code review skills.

Task:

In this assignment, students will have the opportunity to review their peers' system-level applications, emphasizing safe coding practices and safety analysis. Code reviews play a crucial role in maintaining code quality and safety in Rust projects, particularly when dealing with unsafe code sections.

Instructions:

Preparation for Code Review:

Assign each student a peer with whom they will exchange their system-level applications.
Provide clear instructions for the code review process.
Code Review:

Instruct students to thoroughly review their peer's code, paying special attention to sections where unsafe Rust is used.
Encourage students to provide feedback on the safety of these sections, looking for potential issues and vulnerabilities.
Safety Analysis and Feedback:

Have students write a safety analysis report for their peer's code. In this report, they should:
Identify specific sections where unsafe Rust is used and describe the reasons for using it.
Analyze the safety measures implemented in these sections.
Provide feedback and recommendations for improving safety, if necessary.
Emphasize the importance of constructive feedback and suggestions for enhancing code safety.
Peer Discussion:

Arrange a discussion session where students can share their findings and feedback with their peers.
Encourage students to engage in a constructive dialogue about safety measures and the use of unsafe Rust in each other's projects.
Reflect on Code Review:

Have students reflect on what they've learned from both reviewing and receiving feedback on their code.
Ask them to consider how the code review process has influenced their understanding of safe coding practices.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

The depth and thoroughness of their code review, with a focus on identifying safety issues related to the use of unsafe Rust.
The quality of the safety analysis report, including clear explanations and recommendations.
Active participation and engagement in the peer discussion session.
Reflection on the code review process and its impact on their understanding of safe coding practices.
